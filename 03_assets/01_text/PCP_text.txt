FORWARD

We started this project in the summer of 2002 during the height of baseball, and Brandon Inge was bringing in all of the wins for our beloved Tigers. We were 22 and filled with ideas of the way the world should’ve been. It started off as mere observations, then a collection of notebooks, and suddenly… the eight of us has become anthropologists, critical cultural observants, writers and politicians. At the time we were attending meetings about surveillance, independent film festivals, concerned citizens meetings in the basement of Revolution Books, thumbing through every newspaper with fervor to catalog the essence of our passions and unarticulated plans. We studied avant guard architectural movements of the 1960s, from Superstudio’s technomorphic architecture and future research to Ant Farm’s affordable inflatable homes and nomadic philosophies. We were feeling generally hemmed by the city of Detroit, heartbroken and hopeful, we resolved to develop a strategic framework for revitalizing our home. It was then we made a collective decision to organize around designing optimism. It is not politically rigorous or sensitive to meet the plans and wallets of our largest policy makers and and other golden pens. 
We researched everything from Walt Disney’s utopias, Chinese string gardens, the European space program, Jean loc Goddard films, African fractal patterns, short stories by Jorge Luis Borges over the span of six years. The juxtapositions of research are almost nonsensical, but they took us places unimaginable from the get-go. But still, we were and are fundamentally motivated by the citizens of Detroit. Whatever outlandish ideas we came across, generated or explored, we always had to remind ourself to drag it back into the context of Detroit. These people should live in a place more in touch with the fantasy of our integral desires and… oh… the possibilities we crave. These experiments drew us into madness. Its hard for you to fully realize. To us this city became a lab where we became the scientist, the lab and the test subjects. Before we went to sleep at night we tucked our manuscript bibles under our pillows and dreamed. The issues of our time became temporary discomforts, we see the problems of reality, we always have but now… now they seem like puzzles to be linked and discarded. 
By the age of 27, our love of the city of Detroit manifested itself into a 47 page proposal to the mayor (at the time, Kwame Kilpatrick) but through conflicts within our group, the manuscript was shelved and tabled and eventually boxed and unboxed reformed and re-understood and now it has been twelve years and now the plan is complete and published and here for you now in all of its paper glory. 
The vision we’ve developed identifies the kind of city we want Detroit to be. Based on the laws of Pataphysics and our innate human capacity to dream, we’ve developed a strategic framework to address Urban Form, Urban Design, Housing and Community Development, Environment, and Infrastucture and Public Services. We will address the current issues facing Detroit and and outline and detail our ideas to solve these problems, many of which are already in certain stages of initiation in the city. 
The Pataphysics City Project was born out of all of these oddities and explorations and years of trials and triumphs within the boundaries of Detroit. This experiment won’t stop, we expect to take these projects into further evaluation and refinement 



—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MISSION & OBJECTIVES
_

To realize a shared vision of the city, the citizens must refine a strategic framework set in place. The future is  within us, it writhes in the dreams of the residents, in the reflections of the elderly and the scribbles of children. They are drafted by the intellectuals, refined over conversations and brought to fruition through trial/error. From the current state of Detroit, this plan will encourage public engagements, and strategic solutions for some of the hardest issues that this city currently struggles from. The citizens of Detroit have had enough being subjected to the iron plans of politicians and policymakers. This future share vision will transform Detroit into a utopian model for cities yet to come.

PROCESS
_
There were many ideas but unless there was a process in the works to speedily prototype the interactions, there could be no final form with merit. In a warehouse on Greenfied road, the majority of the team came together biweekly to build a controlled setting for the facilitation of pedestrian tests. This space and a criteria of tests for quasi real-world conditions gave quick glimpses into the feasibility or the fallibility of the concepts; with the goal being to open up the way for rethinking public spaces.  This process allowed  us to measure and monitor the development expedited the decision making process, led to new inquiries and ... 

The space underwent a number of iterations. The primary modules included an indoor sound system, which may be 

an pedestrain seating area, 

a lighting area




why detroit?
It made sense to us at the time, this being the city that most of us grew up in. 






LAND BUILDING ASSETS
**********************************
_
MUSICALIZING ARCHITECTURE
_ 

The idea to listen to a landscape was not lost on the Greeks, no, it was merely found there. Greece and the other Eastern Mediterranean states were dominated by harsh landscapes an favorable climate and seas. The original Great Thinkers understood the harmony in music and the relationship to definite fractional relations in pitch, the connection to a length of vibrating strings, all resulting from observing the world around them… then asking. Followers of these radical proposals prophecised, before Socrates dreamed. “the paradoxes” of this world, dominated by physics. 

In what is now an abandoned village in Tilos, Greece, each step or misstep you pursue takes on a temporary role of breezes and sensory path making. The essence of each crushed herb or flower will waft around you, creating a soundtrack to a pan

Seasonal weather will take on a different tune. Can you take a walk to listen to a natural album or compilation of nature tracks? Will you vacation all the way to Tilos to listen to a particular Grecian autumn wind storm, howling and caressing each blade of grass and fallen soldier leaf. A particular storm that only last two days out of every year. Will there come a day when Google Maps becomes obsolete because we know the paths and the soundtracks, and we let these instruments take us to where we wanna go, 

For the city of Detroit, we propose such and enchanting system. With the assistance of what we call “sound mirrors,” we hope to achieve this sort of effect, relaxing you as you walk or journey or commute the city streets. We invite Detroit to put the public space back under the feet of the public, through tees human geotechnical constructions. 

For a citizen to build his or her own sound bearing landscape, they will require a few things: certain degree of study of their location’s annual wind flow patterns, sound mirrors and a somewhat hefty arts grant. The work is not futile, people will flock from miles to listen to the unique sounds produced by the city of Detroit. And how will this soundtrack evolve over time? Does the neighborhood of Brightmoor sound any different than the East side? Do certain landmarks in weather history become one-hit wonders for a city? This raises the possibility of building smaller versions of these sound mirrors in urban neighborhoods so that, for instance, Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg sounds different than Mitte, which sounds different than Kreuzberg – which sounds different than South Kensington, which is different than Gramercy Park... Etc. 

You'd always know which district of the city you were in – even which city you were in, full stop – based on what the wind sounded like. 

(Reminder to myself later: if this idea pans out, do some tests in other major cities and create a few albums of a singular location and possible a couple mix tapes in order to get a grand perspective of natural city music and these tapes can we sold on etsy or the like. No, not etsy. I may construct a website merely for the sales and distributions of these city soundtracks.)

Detroit is a prime location for a plan like this given all of the vacancies and spaces to prototype and demographics to set our hypothesis. Never before has a plan like this been implemented as a contemporary hack to a public space problem, but given the fact that Detroit suffers from a lack of people traffic, we hope that by implementing sound structures such as these, we can activate the streets and create an experience for Detroiters and visitors that is uniquely Detroit and can’t be acquired anywhere else in the world currently. The idea of listening to a landscape is not new, but to weave into the current urban fabric would be enhancing to the site’s presence and experiential impact. 



Spend the better part of 11 months with custom listening devices, fixed to clandestine university benches and parking roofs, finding the locations of aural peculiarities.

HOVER CITY (IN CASE OF EMERGENCY)
_

On October 30,1938, the Columbia Broadcasting Station had everyone listening in on radios, looking to the sky for a disaster they we’re sure would hit them at any moment. What they didn’t know what that the broadcast, known as the “Panic Broadcast” was merely and adaption of HG Wells’ novel The War of the Worlds. Citizens panicked that their world was crumbling. But who’s to say that these disasters, man-produced or otherwise aren’t potentials.  

Many people speculation over the imminent disasters facing Detroit. Mostly these disasters are economic, but we’ve seen enough strife to seriously wonder “What if the city all went down?” This post-industrial, visually apocalyptic city that we love could easily collapse. 

In 2007, a design competition call What if New York City…, architects and city planners were asked:

“What if New York City were hit by a Category 3 hurricane? What if the most densely residential city in the country loses hundreds of thousands of homes in a few hours? What if millions are left with nowhere to live, to work, or to go to school? What if subways flood, streets close, and whole neighborhoods are submerged by up to 23 feet of ocean water and battered by 130 mile-per-hour winds? What if New Yorkers need a place to live during years of reconstruction?”

At the Pataphysics City Society, we fully realize Detroit’s potential to go down in some incidental attack. In order to circumvent these types of disasters, we are ripping a page from the book of these intelligent dreamers and are realizing their dream. We’ve been thinking realistically at the more imaginary question, “Could we simply migrate into the sky?”

“The homes can be rapidly deployed with minimal site preparation. They are intended to ‘plug in’ to existing utility services, and can be deployed by a team of four workers in roughly an hour. Once airborne, the floating homes allow construction crews below to work unimpeded, speeding up the recovery effort. This in turn reduces cost overruns and unnecessary delays.”

This hovering metropolis will be easy enough to construct, someday soon we could all be up in the sky.

EXQUISITE CORPSE ARCHITECTURE
_

On May 10, 2010 Gary Chalmers of Burt & Co Architecture Associates held what he called “An evening of Psychometric Experiments, Architectural Labyrinth Drawing, and Free Bourbon.” The event was much anticipated by Chalmers’ associates and a handful of mysteriously but carefully selected individuals. Over a series of drawing games and bossa nova music, . The game that bore the most interesting results was a spin off of exquisite corpse, titled “ Urban Chamber.” It was much like the Exquisite Corpse game. Instead of the normal head/body/legs/feet sequence, we substituted roof/upper floor/ground floor/basement. Each architect was given a section of a page and after a few drinks, asked to build a utopia before they passed the drawing to the next person in the sequence. Fountain-filled swan gardens sat on top of skeleton chambers on top of Chinese monasteries on top of cookie-cutter office buildings. The Frankenstein of results urged the group to set up themes to each round of the game, for example: suburb, urban farm, industrial, downtown, etc. 

Urban plans were being generated faster than any planner in the world has ever attempted. The consistent narrative style of this approach provided the architects with a series of like-minded structures and styles. The multi-authorship built a new vision for a city, untamed by the conventions or convictions of what architecture and urban planning are suppose to be. Its anti-logical and rooted in accident, yet we could argue that these new logic are the only tools which simply relieve us from the self-replicating droll of contemporary architecture and urban design. 
 
After arduous meetings with Paul Hibbard of the Pataphysics City Society, Gary has decided to work with our team in realizing some of these artistic structures. Currently there are only sketches and scale models, however this year the team will be working out site-plans and safety-code approval.

GIANT URBAN SWINGS
_

The Ford Motor Company is seeking new avenues of invention, one might say in the direction of civic intervention. During lengthy press conferences in August 2013, Ford announced that they will be investing in giant urban swings. There are to be twelve giant swings installed annually. The project will be monitored the first year and continued upon its success. Surely neighborhoods everywhere could use one of these marvels. It would be a nice cool down during a hot summer, a nice break between bumper to bumper traffic, or a joyous ride while you wait for the bus. These swings are intended to be permanent fixtures and not temporary structures. Ford is duly excited about these swings however is also considering giant seesaws if this project should be overlooked and unused by the public.

BIODOMES
The City of Detroit Brownfield Cleanup (DBC) has near doomed certain areas of Detroit in terms of Operation Green Bubble. The latest development DBC had made in working with us at the Pataphysics City Society is to create biodomes in locations that are currently under poor conditions (e.g. air and ground pollution.)  Since 2008, DBC has been examining the soil content and air qualities of several sample locations
DBC was established in 1996 as amended to promote the revitalization of environmentally distressed and blighted areas within our city. Under Act 381, developers of properties that are located in Detroit, that qualify as contaminated, blighted, or functionally obsolete and are part of an approved Brownfield plan, may be eligible for Tax Increment Financing (TIF) reimbursement for both environmental and non-environmental activities. These eligible activities include baseline environmental assessments and remediation, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, site preparation, and public infrastructure improvements. 
Since the program’s inception, the DBC has facilitated the approval of over 198 plans for Brownfield redevelopment including residential, mixed-use, retail, office and commercial uses. Once completed, these plans are expected to create approximately $6.7 billion in new investment, 18,500 jobs, and over 10,000 housing units in the City of Detroit.  
The anatomy of the domes (fig 2.3) is an evolution of early Buckminster Fuller sketches. Fuller, the father of all dome structures and the forefront of the original sustainability movement, synthesized the biosphere from his perspectives on philosophy and art. The Montreal Biosphere has included a variety of environmental themes such as Climate Warning and H2O Variations.
The four premier biodomes will be constructed at the 4 most toxic places in the city, 1) Wyoming and Orangelawn Streets 2) Gratiot Avenue and Rosemary Street 3) West Chicago and Livernois Avenue 4) Mack Avenue and Helen Street. These neighborhoods are not only breeding grounds for toxic pollution, they 
There are severe human costs as well. The polluted sites are subjecting residents and city employees to health and other hazards. Half of Michigan’s young children with elevated blood levels of lead live in Detroit, according to a 2012 study by the Michigan Department of Community Health.  Detroit hospitalizations for asthma are three times the state level. There are 602 cancer cases, adjusted for age, per 100,000 people in Detroit. That compares with 544 in Michigan and 523 in the United States, according to the National Program of Cancer Registries, part of the Centers for Disease Control. The Packard Plant, the Detroit Riverfront, and Belle Isle are a few more properties where stories of pollution flourish. 
The plan is to start construction around May of 2015 and after an incubation period of six months, the DBC will determine whether or not to expand Operation Green Bubble will expand to more hubs. The objective of this project is to protect environmental assets in areas currently too toxic to cultivate much growth. They will serve as smaller research facilities

UNDERGROUND TUNNELS

TALES FROM THE UNDERGROUND
DETROIT SALT MINES REOPENED FOR AMBIGUOUS  SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS 

The Detroit Salt Mine Industry is older than the automobile industry. Some 1,200 feet underneath the city of north end of Allen Park and Dearborn’s Rouge complex and most of Melvindale runs 100 miles of subterranean roads over approximately 1,500 acres. These salt mines are older than the dinosaurs. 
The enormous rock salt deposit During the end of the nineteenth century, the Detroit Salt and Manufacturing Company became bankrupt and lost many men in the processes of mining these salt tunnels. The tunnels they dug are deeper than the Empire State Building is tall. 
In 2010 the Pataphysics City Society took a closer look at the caves and geared up for some tunnel exploration. 
From Conner Corbett’s report on the initial exploration of the tunnels:
	 I had no idea that this was possible, to just cross a gate and walk down to endless abyss. I’m only at 176 floors below zero, and I’m perfectly intact. Its dark but I am enjoying the view. The pressure is killing me through this suit that weighs me down like I carry the sun. 
The next six months were spent mapping the system, it is still much much incomplete but approximately 312 acres are mapped out. 
	 Eventually you become adjusted to the conditions. It is honestly the  adventurous and the restless that will really own the earth. 
The plan is rent the space out to Future Biological Systems Knowledge (FBSK) and Transcendental Knowledge Office (TKO). FBSK is a biosafety and experimental consulting firm currently located in Birmingham, Alabama. This firm has a specialty in future bio-technology as well as atomic bioweapons and environmental development. 
Carl Lipman founded FBSK after 23 years at the Yale Center for Biological Physics, focusing on biotechnology. Carl and his team requested the space to carry out the myriad of experiments that will contribute to the advancement of their goals and missions. 

PCS
First of all, can you explain to us a little about what biosafety is?
CARL LIPMAN
What we do is most often related to microorganisms, and combining several different fields to control and channel those behaviors and toxins. Achieving biosafety means that we use engineering controls, personal protective technologies and immunizations against the variety of disease agents. There are many different methods we are 
PCS
What are you building these machines for.
CARL LIPMAN
Well, for safety on many different levels, from disease-causing agents to large scale nuclear wars. We call ourselves a multidisciplinary practice because we tackle such a vast field of problems. Publis health is very important to us. We need these underground caverns for our team to experiment and live in. We’ll actually be designing biosafe spaces and we need these spaces to be away from the general public. 
PCS
Okay, so the group will be in fact living in these old caves. Is that safe? How long will they be there and what about their families?
CARL LIPMAN
When you dedicate you’re life to science… nothing else truly matters in this world.
PCP
Wow, I admire your dedication. Are there other laboratories or organizations that are doing similar things as you or that you can identify with?
CARL LIPMAN
Bezier Labs in Russia is doing interesting things with moon rocks. It started with a straightforward question: what happens if we bring samples back from Mars? In that case, there was a dual concern. On the one hand, if the samples that came back happened to have an infectious agent in them, then we wanted to make sure we could protect the workers—and that’s pretty much the same way you would protect the workers in a level four facility.
PCP
Will the citizens of Detroit notice what’s going on below their city, 1,200 feet  underground?
CARL LIPMAN
Haha, I don’t think we’ll be causing any type of ruckus that anyone will be able to hear. But we’re really happy to be coming to Detroit. Being such an iconic place of industry and manufacturing, we only hope to add to the legacy that is already here. Never before has a project like this been attempted and we’re very excited to get rolling. The facilities will take approxametly two yearsto construct and in 2016, 32 of us will be moving in. You see… with the difference in pressure it would not be feasible for us to “commute” daily. The work will be much more successful when we are engrossed in the environment. 
PCP
What sort of research questions or areas of study does FBSK hope to traverse in the future? Any innovations on the horizon?
CARL LIPMAN
That’s an interesting question. A few years ago, the United States set out to build more containment laboratories. This actually started before 9/11, as we tried to get more hospitals to have their TB work done at level three, rather than at level two. But, then, of course, after 9/11, a lot of money got pumped into the system, and there have been a whole bunch of labs built since then, both level three and level four. 
However, I also think we’re going to see more international growth of the field. I have a project I’ve been working on for the last five or six years now, trying to see if we can establish a standard for biosafety professionals that would be recognized globally. The World Health Organization recognizes 196 different countries, and probably only 20 of them have what you would consider a reasonable biosafety program. 
I think we’re going to see this gradually grow. Our concept of the world is shrinking all the time, in terms of how quickly we can move and how quickly agents can move around. And these little bugs don’t carry passports and they don’t honor borders, and we have to be vigilant. The avian flu and, now, the H1N1—and who knows what it will be next year. But there’s more and more international cooperation on this kind of stuff, and I think it’s wonderful.

LABYRINTH GARDENS

LABYRINTH GARDENS

Buckley Grover of the Dandelion Academy of Architecture and Urban Planning has been constructing full scale labyrinths since 1991, mainly out of Melbourne. He tests people’s spatial reactions to these geometric wonderlands. He builds movement - typology maps, diagrams that show architectural motion-analysis. He studies user behavior within these spaces. He tests their frustrations, but more importantly, he’s testing their level of delight. 
His objective is to consistently push this sense of delight. “I hope that one day my work may evoke…may provoke… a sense of endless delight.” Considering the levels of success he’s achieves thus far with hedge mazes, glass prisms, space towers, and madman’s lairs, we may ask ourselves if we should incurporate physical mazes into all of our everyday spaces. 
The answer to that quandary is… we obviously can’t do that. But we can help our architects, commercial, residential and landscape to look closer at the way humans familiarize themselves within spaces, and constantly remind these designers to build more interesting spaces, to “evoke delight” as Grover puts it. 
“A path system can be multicursal: a network of interconnecting routes, intended to disorient even the cunning. It may contain multiple branches and dead ends, specifically designed to confuse the occupant. This is a maze. 
“Alternatively, a path can form a single, monocursal route. Once embarked upon, this may fold, twist and turn, but will remain a constant and ultimately reach a destination; this is a labyrinth. 
“The experience of walking these two topologies is very different.”
Grover has written a manual, Traces of Spaces and Wanderous Places for how spatial designers can evoke a sense of continual delight in the user of the buildings that we go on to design. He asks how architects might actually construct "a path that switches from a labyrinth into a maze (and vice-versa).
“This type of cognition… its adventurous and strange”
	 You can have a moment that is spatially unfamiliar and will erupt—and from movement-pathway studies we can extrapolate architectural form. Buildings that perfectly rest at the cognitive flipping point between maze and labyrinth, familiar and disorienting, adventurous and strange. 
We at the Pataphysics City Society have, based on Grover’s experiments, have been implementing some of his techniques and conducting our own experiments with labyrinths within Detroit. 23 Architects were contracted to design labyrinths that would evoke a sense of joy to the wonderer. They were each given an empty lot, five hundred dollars and twenty test subjects. For two years we tried these experiments and failed. Trial after trial, the mazes and labyrinths did not create joy, delight or wander. The breakthrough came in July 2013, when we decided to host a workshop at Detroit’s Waldorf Elementary School. Ms. Widley’s 3rd grade class draw mazes for an hour for us, with every ounce of child-like joy they could muster. Those 26 drawings were then given to one of our architects to finalize the designs before we had them constructed. Nine of these mazes produced the highest levels of delight we’ve ever seen. These nine are going to be produced at a larger scale in many of the urban fields around Detroit. 
When we returned to Ms. Widley’s class, the children were watching The Twilight Zone, an older science fiction tv show. As Hollywood robots pursue a rural maid in vintage black and white, a small boy, Jameth Cors, proclaimed that we should have robots tend the gardens. After careful consideration, we determined that would be a brilliant solution to a traditionally human problem. Gebroeders Ezendam BV is an Austrian company that manufactures many things, one of them being tending robots for plant nurseries. Their Globus Maximus machine can shear 500 nature cubes per hour, though they have new models that shear 5000 per hour. Unheard of! Their GPS and LIDAR scanning system constructs a 3D map for the most precise grooming known to shearing science. These Edwards Scissorhands cyborgs will be found with shiny chrome grins, strolling through the gardens. 






CITY SYSTEMS

the first area is to clean up the physical city
environment affects psychology
- police and firefighters - drones monitor the noise levels to ensure domestic 
- medical industry is pretty large, we just received a large sum through our kickstarter campaign to set up mobile medicine trucks to give out vaccination and lollies. Writing checklists for schizophrenics and checking spelling errors on pill bottles for the elderly. 

 
- ceremony festival of burning past ills - and glitter. We’re in contact with key individuals from the Detroit Pop-Up Parade group, who gave a show along the river walk in Summer 2013. In fact it was their only show, a unique opportunity of sorts brought that group together. They met for the first time only the day before, did you know that? It’s resourceful, intrepid young folk like these that are going to front this renaissance.

BICYCLE IN AIR 
_
 Detroit biking culture is increasing at a rate like we;ve never seen. Famous for being The Motor City, there was little hope that we’d ever be able to loosen our dependency on cars. 
The organization in charge of the elevated bike path plan is the is the Bicycles in Air (BIA) who is collaborating with the Hub is midtown Exterior Architecture, Foster + Partners, and Space Syntax could help to make London’s roads safer for cyclists, in addition to having applications for other major cities worldwide.
They call it BIA Network, a network of bike paths that would be constructed above existing railroad lines and could put cyclists in the sky. Architect Blake Shinter estimates that it will cut commuting times for Detroiters in half. “If you are coming from a nearby city like Royal Oak or Grosse Pointe, 
Car accidents and pedestrian accidents as well, climbed 32% from last year. With more and more cars on the street than ever before, commuting times from a city like Ferndale, Michigan to downtown could take 40 minutes. Only a year ago it would have been twenty minutes. 
“The only problems we could see with a primarily biking commute was ”
According to a press release from Foster + Partners, each route could accommodate up to 12,000 cyclists per hour and improve travel times by 29 minutes. It’s an efficient use of space in a city whose population is expected to grow by as much as 12% over the next 10 years.  
Plus, developing a usable bike system with 200 entrance points in heavily populated areas could be good for the local economy. 
“Early studies of a SkyCycle system indicate that it provides capacity at a much lower cost than building new roads and tunnels,” a press release from Foster + Partners says. “The possibility of the deck providing development opportunities for businesses along the route, particularly where it intersects with stations and bridges, has also been the subject of the study, exploring ideas for public/private commercial growth and regeneration.” 





WEATHER FARMS

Weather control is the future of urban design. Nothing speaks worse to a city when it can’t protect its homeless from a simple thunder storm .

The Pataphysics City Society has been looking back at Detroit weather patterns over 58 years, 
According to the patent application from 2012, the machine will alter weather using space-born energy. Complicated geometry of mirrors will work in tandem with meteorological tracking technology. 	 Power system elements are launched into orbit, and the free-floating power system elements are maintained in proper relative alignment, e.g., position, orientation, and shape, using a control system. Energy from the space-based power system is applied to a weather element, such as a hurricane, and alters the weather element to weaken or dissipate the weather element. The weather element can be altered by changing a temperature of a section of a weather element, such as the eye of a hurricane, changing airflows, or changing a path of the weather element.
We interviewed Matthew Zone, electrical engineer at Detroit Future Weather, (DFW) the organization who wrote the patent on the weather machine

“Well… maybe down the road we can look into err… traffic conditions. We’re primarily concerned with people, more specifically, the people that are affected poorly by the spontaneous Michigan weather— the homeless man being pelted by hail, the rained out baseball game, the cloudy wedding. We will be creating microclimates,”

“Weather control is the future of urban design. Nothing speaks worse to a city when it can’t protect its homeless from a simple lightning storm. Cities can very realistically attempt to engineer specialty microclimates. Beijing’s Olympic efforts at weather control last summer for instance. That was a project they used as a as a new means of attracting new residents and future development. What’s fascinating about the matter is that it seems entirely possibly that we might put into orbit a private, geostationary solar farm with which a city could not only power its delirious experiments in beach refrigeration and large-scale air-conditioning, but actually create a new climate for the city. One could easily stop a hurricane though, and that is beautiful, but one could create a hurricane and wipe out the next town. It’s imperative that we use these tools with discretion. 

I spend nine and a half months in a mental institution in Northville. I was innocent, unlucky by circumstance. I agreed to be... er under no medication if I promised to be heterosexual. It was then I met Fredrick North. He was naked on the carpet with a cigarette and said to me... "know thyself then be shit." A new windowed opened up for me. 

We worshiped Walt Whitman and speculated on the pornographic lives of the guards. Fredrick was receiving shock treatment and I was painfully pretending to be normal. When normal people engage in conversation, they default to this... changing states of water and temperature. In a place like that the flick of lights become day and night, there is no natural life.

BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE

What a marvelous thing it is to have a waterway like that of the Detroit River. Come view the skylines of Detroit and Windsor on the river from the view of bubble rides.

Wether you ride for recreation or for work, bubble rides can be the whimsical glide you’ll never forget. You can walk, run, dog paddle, float and much much more. Skeptics once scoffed at the human potential for flight. No one thought that the early automobiles would make it across the United States… but look how far we’ve come and what could be next? vacuum tubes, underwater planes, space elevators and bicycles in the sky. 

They smell like grapefruit. 

in 1945, german military espionage group were charged to deliver 5.5 million in gold to the french underground. instead of delivering the gold they ran to america with it. They hid it in New York, with expectation of returning. Until Mick Scobey stole it all and ran to Detroit, the greatest place in the country at that time. We don't know what happened to the money after that. We don't know what became of Mick Scobey.

ESSENCE PRESERVATION
___
immaculate collection - archive of the sound, capturing the moment and culture. Esteban J Juno interview on radio. 

Maybe that’s the problem with the world today. This SAVE button has become so much more accessible so we take so much time to record thoughts we think are great thoughts or save memories in photographic pictures. We spend all of this time to remember later or for posterity's sake when really… they are going to be out there making memories of their own, recording and looking back at they. Live now brothers! WHO really spends their life going through the memories of others? Well… most of us do. Social media. We feel the need to record every thought that we think is a clever thought. Looking for other’s validation that it was a clever thought, or merely their opinion. I thought for so long, I still think, (based on my opinion that no one reads what I write) that no one wants to hear what I say, that is a reason I did not use social media websites for so long. If you don’t want to hear me, I won’t talk at all, and I wont ask you to either. But I want people to listen, before I can’t say anything at all. We spend so much excessive time looking into what other people are doing. Well, to each his own I suppose. We're all becoming ADD or something.

But what really matters in the end?---> It's all just death and nothing. Does recording matter? The things we like and don’t? Getting as good as we can at a trade? As intelligent as we can? Affecting the world in a positive manner? Making people smile? Not being miserable? Falling in love?  Being remembered?

What defines regret and what book can I read that will tell me how to get the most out of my time on this floor? In this classroom I sit, stand and ask questions. Then later I make up my own answers.

And in the house of my daydreams I like to play. Perhaps that is the basis of my manifesto. My life purpose is to just have fun. Explore, challenge all the rules and make up my own. Listen to good music, dance around a little and play. One day I’ll fall in love. I’ll add music to the songs I write. Live real loud, act like a rockstar. Be somebody’s someone. Make others happy because I’m selfish and it makes me happy.

I want people to remember me, is that so bad? I like my mystery, my eyes are TV scenes. But we don’t know how TVs work, we just change the channel screens.

HELICOPTER HOUSES

James Verne, engineer and architecture professor at Wayne State University has been 
When Detroit shrunk dramatically, people were very concerned about gentrification. “Gentrification can mean”

We’re hoping that people will more utilize their houses if they can become more mobile. 

In 1964 Ron Herron of Archigram proposed a Walking City

These houses would also eliminate the need for certain types of travel. These are going to be the homes of the mourn day gypsies. 

“We aim to elevate structures into the glory of the sky, getting them off the anonymity of the street, to become fantasized again.”

“In the threatening situation of the world today, when people are beginning to see that everything is at stake, the projection-creating fantasy soars beyond the realm of earthly organizations and powers into the heavens, into interstellar space, where the rulers of human fate, the gods, once had their abode in the planets,” Jung wrote. “Even people who would never have thought that a religious problem could be a serious matter that concerned them personally are beginning to ask themselves fundamental questions.”

Ultimately, even though it’s not a photograph, or a painting, or a sculpture, or even one of the many yurts around the Station to Station stops, Coffin said his UFO fits in with universal purpose of art. And much like cubist artists were inspired by the new technologies and scientific discoveries happening in their time, he hopes his work can be reflective of discoveries science has yet to make – if they are indeed out there.

Isn’t this a dangerous plan? Elevated houses

TREEHOUSE NEIGHBORHOOD - RETURN TO THE FOREST
_


“We’re linking up more than two hundred tiny sensors, robots, cameras and computers to create a forest that mimics the modern world we live in. If a tree falls in the forest… we’ll hear it live over the internet.”

Not this isn’t a scene out of Jurrasic Park where everything is monitored for dinosaur and human safety, but rather, this is the first Smart Forest. 

The vast urban parries of Detroit will connect. A 140 acre forestry project will be developed in the middle of detroit, consuming most of the East Side for the stray animals

The application of this new forest is more absurd than you may first realize. ### has a budget of $200 million to plan and implement this forest and an estimated 2,000 tree houses for the homeless. 


The forest will be implanted with smart devices and become a very large network that combines motes and portable gear with larger technologies

Pat Forksunson clips his nails on a cool March grass patch  in New Center Park. 
"what's this?" "Agents of my overworked desk job, escaping they are..."
"can i have a sandwich please?"
"what kind of sandwich?"
"why that's, that's quite remarkable yes quite remarkable. I wonder... what led you down this path of research? "
"Arther Plin of course! Arther Plin changed my life."
(pulls out cherry pipe tobacco and begins to smoke)

"Please go on will you?"
"Adieu"

We'll all be screaming with joy. Forget your anxiety medications, you're free.

HAMMOCK INSTALLATIONS

Architecture schools across Michigan and a few in Eastern Europe were asked to solve a the urban furniture problem in Detroit. 22-year-old Juan David of Huuagersher School of Architecture and Urban Planning in Berlin took a very simple approach that was easy and effective enough to increase relaxation across the board v


The project’s first phase will be an installation of 46 hammocks that will be installed on Hammond Street this upcoming July. 

The hammock is made from one simple form so it is easy to manufacture and it is versatile in use as either a hammock or a temporary shelter. The hammocks will be suspended from city trees and lamp posts. Each hammock comes with a lamp to help ensure the safety of the sleeper. Eating brown rice and papaya for Bunny Brown in Minnesota.

TYPOGRAPHIC GOOGLE MAPS
_

If you ever look close at Google Earth Maps, you’d never know but might be surprised at a few anomalies in sight. The warping in perspectives, buildings gone vertigo, discrepancies in the data. IT looks like some kind of a Futurist mapping. Even via satellite photography, our world obscures and alters what it intends to communicate… creating a new narrative in a city. These errors reveal manipulation of an original but they also give us the false sense that these views were constructed for the intention of this viewer. 

Mack Lannoo of PCS has been working on charting the buildings downtown Detroit to create a typographic message that could be seen easily from Google Maps. 
“It will be a message unlike any message any city has ever sent.” says Lannoo
“What kind of message is that Mark?” implores Taylor Lawton, one of our collegues at the weekly PCP shindig. 
“That Detroit is Godly.” We later caught up with Mack, who, after a few drinks disclosed how he came up with this unorthodox plan. In  It’s 1:13AM, Mack in his loose drunken state, recants a line, that I internet-searched later, it’s from Leonardo Da Vinci, Mack said “when you have tasted flight you will forever wander the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and for there you will always long to return.”
In 2009 Mack staged a hoax of unyielding proportion when he photoshoped the statement into a skyline and posed several organizations (also made up) for facilitating the facade treatments. The scandal went on for several weeks, before a channel 4 news helicopter exposed the phoney. Mack was fired from his position at the ### and publicly shamed by major local news providers. His obsession didn’t cease and 8-10 months later, give or take, Mack teamed up with local artist collective Time Space Timing (TST)

Mark is currently working with the Topographic Cybernetic Programme (TCP) and the Happiness Syndicate (HS) to  develop the message and the method of either building manipulation or satellite imagery manipulation to craft this skyward typography. The estimated timeline for this project is over the next ten years.

FINAL REMARKS
_

As we’ve shared this strategic framework, things have changed and have been added and recanted and we’re always talking about different ways of building a strong infrastructure. We see new things and adapt and all of the trends or happenings affect us because we are flexible, we move and change with this city. We’ve studied it thoroughly and have made plans to compliment what is already here because we love the city, its spaces, its neighborhoods, its 714,000 people and its landscapes. All of the people working and hoping for change… we hope that this future vision will lift their spirits and engage in the city, making their own claim for positive change. WE’ve been seeing them do that for years and it remains the most inspiring thing about Detroit to us. It is only through the will of the people that their  The optimism we see was the main inspiration and motivation for developing this project out of the bounds of the imaginary, out of ideas in notebooks, and into the urban utopia of Detroit. 

Rise with the spirit of angel dust.
